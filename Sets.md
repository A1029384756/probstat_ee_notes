### Set Notation
Let $A$, $B$ be sets (events)
$A \cup B$ is the *union* of $A$ and $B$, all outcomes are in $A$, $B$, or both $A$ and $B$.

**Ex:** $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
$B=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$
$A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\}$

$A \cap B$ is the *intersection* of $A$ and $B$, all outcomes are in *both* $A$ and $B$.
$A \cap B = \{1,3,5\}$

$A-B$ is the set of all outcomes in $B$ that are not found in $A$.
$B-A=\{7,9\}$

### Special Sets
$\{S\}$ → Sample space for a particular problem (all outcomes)
$\{\varnothing\}$ → empty/null set (no outcomes)
$A'$ → ($A$ complement) All things in $\{S\}$ that are not in A
$S'=\varnothing$ ↔ $\varnothing'=S$
For any $A$, $A \cup A' = S$
For any $A$, $A \cap A' = \varnothing$
