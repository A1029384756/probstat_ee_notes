**Def:** Event - Something that might happen
$P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{outcomes in event}}{\text{outcomes in sample space}}$

- **Ex:** (Industrial Fair) Your company entered $5$ of the $12$ products in the competition.
	- $P(\text{your company wins all 3 medals}) = \frac{5^{(3)}}{12^{(3)}} = 0.45$ <- Uses [[Combinatorics#Ordered lists without replacement |Permutations]]
- **Ex:** Buy new speakers for my entertainment room.
	- 6 models in my price range.
	- Bring my favorite music, listen to the speakers
	- Listening order?
	- What is the number of possible listening orders?
	- Permutation with $n = 6$ and $\text{num orders} = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6! = 720$
